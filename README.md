# My-first-jupyter-notebook
This jupyter notebook is the first file that was created during the assignment of my course "Tools for Data Science" by coursera. It just contains 6 cells tells about some basics operations on jupyter notebook like making heading tags, markdown cells, bold text, italic text and some code in python.
